I asked:
I want to write a book named Homo Idiots, A Counter-Intuitive Approach to a Funnier Life. This is a story of two guys falling in love with a girl in a computer science college, MIT maybe, MIT, falling in love with a girl, with an Arab girl from Palestine. One is from Israel and another is from Syria, and they, and the girl herself loves another person from Ukraine. So this story revolves around the silly events and jokes that they do to attract each other. And the boy from Ukraine has lost his love in the war between Ukraine and Russia and cannot tolerate the trauma. The Syrian girl doesn't know about her sister, which were captivated by ISIS in Syria, and one of her biggest wishes in life is to see her sister again, her younger sister, of course. And this is the plot of the story, I just want to start it with some suggestions and I want to publish it on GitHub, make it Creative Commons 0 license, so everybody can modify it and make their own version.

  I got:
  Here you go, Zohair — a clean, powerful starting blueprint for your book Homo Idiots: A Counter-Intuitive Approach to a Funnier Life, plus suggestions for structure, tone, characters, and how to publish it under CC0 on GitHub.

✨ Book Blueprint: Homo Idiots

A Counter-Intuitive Approach to a Funnier Life

1. Core Tone & Style

This book works best if you write it as:

Comedy + tragedy + philosophy, all mixed in

Fast, sharp dialogues

Silly misunderstandings (because they’re “Homo Idiots”)

But under the surface → deep pain, war trauma, lost love, culture conflict, identity

MIT campus atmosphere → high-tech + emotional chaos


Think The Big Bang Theory mixed with A Serious Man and A Fault in Our Stars.

2. Main Characters

1. Samir (the Syrian guy)

21–22 years old

Computer science nerd, brilliant but socially broken

Carries trauma: his little sister was kidnapped by ISIS

His humor is dark, sarcastic

Falls in love with the Palestinian girl

Afraid to show his emotions

Dreams of building an AI that can search for missing people in war zones


2. Itai (the Israeli guy)

Tall, awkward, ultra-smart

His jokes always create political disasters unintentionally

Loves peace and wants to “apologize for the whole region”

Falls in love with the same girl

Tries way too hard, causing funny chaos

His insecurity: his family always expects him to be a “genius soldier,” but he wants to be a poet


3. Layan (the Palestinian girl)

Beautiful but very intellectual

Arab from Palestine, grew up under occupation

Studying computer vision

Very independent

She doesn’t love any of the two…

Because she is secretly in love with the Ukrainian boy

Her dream: rewrite the story of her homeland with tech, not politics


4. Oleh (the Ukrainian boy)

Quiet, trauma-filled, gentle soul

Lost the girl he loved in the war

Studies cybersecurity at MIT

He cannot open his heart again, but Layan is trying

His trauma makes him emotionally unavailable

But he becomes the moral center of the story



---

3. Plot Suggestions

Act 1 — Arrival at MIT

First morning in the programming class

Samir and Itai fight over a chair seat, both trying to sit next to Layan

They accidentally insult each other’s country

Layan rolls her eyes and moves to sit next to Oleh

Both boys realize they have the same crush and declare war

A “funny” war, not real one

The professor calls them “Homo Idiots,” inspiring the title



---

Act 2 — The Silly Battles

Samir writes her Arabic poetry using GPT but GPT translates into Hebrew by accident

Itai tries to impress her by coding a face-recognition app, but it detects her as “Unknown Occupied Territory”

Samir hacks Itai’s code to change the output to “Illegal Settlement”

The whole class laughs

Oleh says nothing, but Layan tries to comfort him

Samir and Itai misunderstand and think Oleh is a villain



---

Act 3 — Real Emotions Break the Comedy

Samir receives a call: a rumor appears about his missing sister

Itai discovers he failed an exam

Layan tries to help both

Oleh breaks down remembering his dead girlfriend

Suddenly all four see each other as humans, not nations



---

Act 4 — The Enlightenment

They realize life is too short

Trauma is too heavy

Politics destroys love

And friendships are more important than ego

Layan stops them from competing

She says: “I don’t belong to anyone. I belong to my future.”

They mature



---

Act 5 — The Counter-Intuitive Ending

You can choose one:

Option A — Funny Ending

They all stay friends; nobody gets the girl.
They create a startup called HomoIdiots.ai where AI solves political arguments by telling jokes.

Option B — Romantic Ending

Layan chooses Oleh.
Samir and Itai accept it, and they team up to find Samir’s sister using AI.

Option C — Bittersweet Ending

Oleh leaves to help in the war; Layan stays.
Samir and Itai finally become best friends.


---

4. Themes to Emphasize

Humans from “enemy” nations can love

Comedy is a survival tool

Tech connects cultures

Trauma shapes identity

Love triangles = good comedy

The world is stupid → hence “Homo Idiots”
