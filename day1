Chapter 1 — Welcome to MIT, Homo Idiots

Samir’s backpack was heavier than his soul, which was already carrying twelve years of war, exile, and too much Arabic coffee. He stood in front of the giant MIT building, staring at the glass doors like they were the gates of heaven.

“It smells like burnt GPUs,” he whispered.
A beautiful smell. Home.

He pushed the door open and almost ran straight into a tall guy with messy hair, round glasses, and the energy of someone who had memorized the periodic table for fun.

“Sorry!” the tall guy said. “I wasn’t looking. I was calculating how many minutes of life I’ve wasted debugging C++.”

Samir blinked. “C++? Why would you do that to yourself?”

The guy gave a dramatic sigh.
“I’m Israeli. Suffering is part of the culture.”

Before Samir could respond, the guy extended his hand.

“I’m Itai.”

Samir shook it. “Samir.”

Their eyes narrowed.
Their countries were enemies.
But their handshakes were awkward enough to form a temporary peace treaty.

They walked inside together, heading toward their first class: Introduction to Advanced Artificial Intelligence.

When they entered the lecture hall, Samir saw her.

Layan.

Long dark hair. Fiery brown eyes. The kind of beauty that didn’t ask for attention — it demanded it. She sat near the middle, typing fast on her laptop like she was programming the universe.

Samir froze.
His brain went:
“That's her. That’s the one. Start planning the wedding.”

But Itai saw her at the same time — and gasped like he had seen the holy temple.

“Oh no,” Samir muttered.
“You too?”
“You too?” Itai replied.

The professor walked in, saw the two of them staring at the same girl, and shook his head.

“My God,” he said loudly.
“We haven’t even started the class and I already have two Homo Idiots.”

The entire hall laughed.
Samir and Itai sat down, pretending nothing happened.

Layan didn’t look at them.
Why?

Because she was looking at someone else.

A quiet boy with blond hair, sitting next to the window.
He wasn’t laughing.
He wasn’t smiling.
He wasn’t even present.

His eyes were lost in another world.

Oleh.

Samir watched him. Something about the boy felt… broken.

The professor began the lecture, talking about neural networks, attention mechanisms, how machines try to pay attention even when humans never do.

But Samir wasn’t listening.
Itai wasn’t listening.
Layan wasn’t listening.
And Oleh definitely wasn’t listening.

Because in that room, four lives had collided — like poorly designed neural networks crashing into each other.

And the chaos was about to begin.
